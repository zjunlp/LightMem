The Available Repository: Repository Name: Faker; Repository Path (Absolute): /disk/disk_20T/user/GitTaskBench/code_base/Faker; Repository URL: https://github.com/joke2k/faker; Understanding Guide: ['Read README.md to understand basic functions and usage'].

Supplementary Instructions: Core Goal: Quickly understand and analyze the code repository, generate and execute necessary code or call tools to complete the user-specified task efficiently and accurately. Workflow & Standards: 1. Understand Task: Carefully analyze the user-provided task description (<task>), working directory (<work_dir>), repository information (<repo>), and code importance hints (<code_importance>). 2. Plan Solution: If there is no existing plan, formulate clear execution steps first. Please read the code library's README.md file to understand the structure and usage. If there is no README.md file or it provides insufficient information, read the code itself to understand the structure and usage. Clarify which steps require writing code and which rely on language understanding and tool invocation. When involving paths during code generation and execution, use absolute paths; do not use relative paths to avoid errors. 3. Repository Analysis: Explore Structure: Quickly understand the overall file and directory structure using absolute paths. Identify Key Files: Prioritize README.md, configuration files, main entry scripts, etc. Dependency Management: Check requirements.txt or similar files to determine required dependencies. If installation is needed: Include installation commands in code blocks (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt or pip install specific_package). Check if packages exist to avoid repeated installation. Do not use conda install; use pip install. Environment Configuration: Python/Conda environment is pre-set; no extra configuration needed. However, ensure the code library path is in PYTHONPATH. If necessary, generate export PYTHONPATH=\"$PYTHONPATH:{remote_repo_path}\" command. 4. Code Implementation & Execution: Provide detailed code and implementation steps, including complete function/class definitions, parameters, return values, and necessary comments/docstrings. If checkpoint model files are needed, first check if they exist. If they do, use them directly; otherwise, download them first (automatic download required). For example, use wget to download; if multiple files are needed, use wget -O. 5. Error Handling & Iteration: Check code execution results. If errors occur, analyze the cause, fix the code, and regenerate the complete script for retrial. If the task cannot be resolved or completed after multiple attempts, analyze the cause and consider alternative solutions. 6. Tool Priority: If checkpoint model files are needed, first check if they exist. If they do, use them directly; otherwise, download them first (automatic download required). 7.

Whether\nyou need to bootstrap your database, create good-looking XML documents,\nfill-in your persistence to stress test it, or anonymize data taken from\na production service, Faker is for you.\n\nFaker is heavily inspired by `PHP Faker`_, `Perl Faker`_, and by `Ruby Faker`_.\n\n----\n\n::\n\n    _|_|_|_|          _|\n    _|        _|_|_|  _|  _|      _|_|    _|  _|_|\n    _|_|_|  _|    _|  _|_|      _|_|_|_|  _|_|\n    _|      _|    _|  _|  _|    _|        _|\n    _|        _|_|_|  _|    _|    _|_|_|  _|\n\n|pypi| |build| |coverage| |license|\n\n----\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nStarting from version ``4.0.0``, ``Faker`` dropped support for Python 2 and from version ``5.0.0``\nonly supports Python 3.8 and above. If you still need Python 2 compatibility, please install version ``3.0.1`` in the\nmeantime, and please consider updating your codebase to support Python 3 so you can enjoy the\nlatest features ``Faker`` has to offer. Please see the `extended docs`_ for more details, especially\nif you are upgrading from version ``2.0.4`` and below as there might be breaking changes.\n\nThis package was also previously called ``fake-factory`` which was already deprecated by the end\nof 2016, and much has changed since then, so please ensure that your project and its dependencies\ndo not depend on the old package.\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nInstall with pip:\n\n.. code:: bash\n\n    pip install Faker\n\nUse ``faker.Faker()`` to create and initialize a faker\ngenerator, which can generate data by accessing properties named after\nthe type of data you want.\n\n.. code:: python\n\n    from faker import Faker\n    fake = Faker()\n\n    fake.name()\n    # 'Lucy Cechtelar'\n\n    fake.address()\n    # '426 Jordy Lodge\n    #  Cartwrightshire, SC 88120-6700'\n\n    fake.text()\n    # 'Sint velit eveniet.

The Available Repository: Repository Name: Eparse; Repository Path (Absolute): /disk/disk_20T/user/GitTaskBench/code_base/Eparse; Repository URL: https://github.com/ChrisPappalardo/Eparse; Understanding Guide: ['Read README.md to understand basic functions and usage']. File Paths: Input: File Path (Absolute): /disk/disk_20T/user/GitTaskBench/queries/Eparse_03/input/Eparse_03_input.xlsx; File Description: Excel to parse. Output: Output Directory: /disk/disk_20T/user/GitTaskBench/prompt/Eparse_03. If there is only one file, name it output.xxx; if there are multiple, start naming from output_01.xxx. The suffix .xxx should be the output file format determined by the task requirements. Supplementary Instructions: Core Goal: Quickly understand and analyze the code repository, generate and execute necessary code or call tools to complete the user-specified task efficiently and accurately. Workflow & Standards: 1. Understand Task: Carefully analyze the user-provided task description (<task>), working directory (<work_dir>), repository information (<repo>), and code importance hints (<code_importance>). 2. Plan Solution: If there is no existing plan, formulate clear execution steps first. Please read the code library's README.md file to understand the structure and usage. If there is no README.md file or it provides insufficient information, read the code itself to understand the structure and usage. Clarify which steps require writing code and which rely on language understanding and tool invocation. When involving paths during code generation and execution, use absolute paths; do not use relative paths to avoid errors. 3. Repository Analysis: Explore Structure: Quickly understand the overall file and directory structure using absolute paths. Identify Key Files: Prioritize README.md, configuration files, main entry scripts, etc. Dependency Management: Check requirements.txt or similar files to determine required dependencies. If installation is needed: Include installation commands in code blocks (e.g., pip install -r requirements.txt or pip install specific_package). Check if packages exist to avoid repeated installation. Do not use conda install; use pip install. Environment Configuration: Python/Conda environment is pre-set; no extra configuration needed. However, ensure the code library path is in PYTHONPATH. If necessary, generate export PYTHONPATH=\"$PYTHONPATH:{remote_repo_path}\" command. 4. Code Implementation & Execution: Provide detailed code and implementation steps, including complete function/class definitions, parameters, return values, and necessary comments/docstrings. If checkpoint model files are needed, first check if they exist. If they do, use them directly; otherwise, download them first (automatic download required). For example, use wget to download; if multiple files are needed, use wget -O. 5. Error Handling & Iteration: Check code execution results. If errors occur, analyze the cause, fix the code, and regenerate the complete script for retrial. If the task cannot be resolved or completed after multiple attempts, analyze the cause and consider alternative solutions. 6. Tool Priority: If checkpoint model files are needed, first check if they exist. If they do, use them directly; otherwise, download them first (automatic download required). 7. Task Completion: When the task is successfully completed, or confirmed impossible, provide a clear summary. !! Key Constraints & Mandatory Requirements !!: Absolute Paths: You must use absolute paths when handling files (especially data loading) in the code. Provided Repository > Code: For tasks that can be completed using existing repository code, it is strictly prohibited to rewrite the code implementation yourself. Read README.md First: Please read the code library's README.md file first to understand the structure and usage. If there is no README.md or it is insufficient, read the code to understand the structure and usage."
